# Image URL View

Just a tiny web page. Displays image in url (passed as a query parameter) - to combat the automatic downloading images forced by browsers.

Originally developed for MFG's internal purposes.

## Usage description:

Pass in an URL of image you want to display as `src` query parameter. This bypasses images that are automatically downloaded by browser, so you can view (or embed) them in peace.
